# programming is how we communicate
# with computers to tell them what to do

# comments are notes in code
# print statements are how we display info to the screen
print("Hello world! this is my first day coding!")


# variables are how we keep track of information
game = "Roblox"

# we can print variables together with
# sentences
print("One of my fav games is " + game)


# we can update variables
game = "Minecraft"
print("Another game i like is " + game)


# every piece of information is called data
# data can have different types

# STRING - Letters, symbols, text, etc. They have quotes
# INTEGER - whole numbers. These dont have quotes
# FLOAT - decimals. These dont have quotes
# BOOLEAN - True/False. These dont have quotes

name = "Justin"  #string
age = 11 #integer
child = True #BOOLEAN
exact_age = 11.5 #FLOAT
