# Python-Platform

## Preface

- The goal of python platform is to get as many students as possible to move up into either 2:1 or 1:1 code coaching.
- Review the code and understand how the program works AT LEAST one day prior to your lesson.
- DO NOT teach a class without looking over the code.
- Homework MUST be included in the notes for each lesson.
- Discuss What each line of code is responsible for and how they interact with each other
- Use these completed programs as a reference as you re-create them with your class in replit.
- Copying comments is optional for students, but include them in your lesson
- Students who can type fast should copy comments.
- Unexperienced typers do not need to copy comments.
- If there are any students who do not complete the lesson, please copy the complete code to your replit and share with the students via replit invite.
