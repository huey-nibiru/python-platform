# Python-Platform

## Preface

- The goal of python platform is to get as many students as possible to move up into either 2:1 or 1:1 code coaching.
- Before beginning your lesson, review the code and understand how the program works and the concepts used.
- DO NOT teach a class without looking over the code.
- Homework MUST be included in the notes for each lesson.
