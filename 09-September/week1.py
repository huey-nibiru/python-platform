# VARIABLES, PRINT STATEMENTS & DATA TYPES


# programming is how we communicate
# with computers to tell them what to do
# comments are notes in code


# print statements are how we display info to the screen
print("Hello world! this is my first day coding!")


# variables are how we keep track of information
game = "Roblox"


# we can print variables together with sentences using the plus operator or comma
print("One of my fav games is" , game + ".")


# we can update variables
game = "Minecraft"
print("Another game i like is " + game)

# STRING - Letters, symbols, text, etc. They have quotes
# INTEGER - whole numbers. These dont have quotes
# FLOAT - decimals. These dont have quotes
